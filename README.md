# Security Analysis of Cordova Applications in Google Play

This Git repository provides Java code, used in the paper "Security Analysis of Cordova Applications in Google Play", presented at FARES workshop, collocated at he ARES 2017 conference, located in Reggio Calabria, Italy.

In this repository does not contain the complete tool as-a-whole, used in the project. It was not developed in the light of further distribution. Therefore, it was full of local, hardcoded dependencies. We do, however, provide all functional code (used for downloading, decompiling and analyzing applications) used for this paper. Even though the provided code will not compile out-of-the-box, it demonstrates how every experiment presented in this paper was performed. Furthermore, it can help other developers and researchers to significantly reduce development times in projects related to this work.

The code used in this work depends on several tools:
- Selenium (http://www.seleniumhq.org)
- APKTool (https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)
- Android-Market-API (https://github.com/jberkel/android-market-api)
