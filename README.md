# Security Analysis of Cordova Applications in Google Play

This Git repository provides Java code, used in the paper "Security Analysis of Cordova Applications in Google Play", presented at FARES workshop, collocated at he ARES 2017 conference, located in Reggio Calabria, Italy.

This repository contains the Java project used for the analysis. Most configurations (such as paths to required resources) can be adjusted in the Configs.java file. Nevertheless, it's possible that minor changes elsewhere in the code are required to make everything work.

The code used in this work depends on several other tools:
- Selenium (http://www.seleniumhq.org)
- APKTool (https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)
- Android-Market-API (https://github.com/jberkel/android-market-api)
